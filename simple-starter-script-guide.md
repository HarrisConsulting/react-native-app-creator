```bash
# ✅ CORRECT:
cp /Users/rogerharris/Projects/ReactNativeTest/scripts/create-react-native-project.sh /Users/rogerharris/Projects/

# ❌ WRONG (missing target):
cp /Users/rogerharris/Projects/ReactNativeTest/scripts/
```

### **Error: "command not found: create-react-native-project.sh"**
**Problem**: Trying to run script from wrong directory or with wrong syntax
**Solution**: Navigate to Projects directory first, then run with `./`
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT:
cd /Users/rogerharris/Projects
./create-react-native-project.sh

# ❌ WRONG (missing ./ prefix):
create-react-native-project.sh

# ❌ WRONG (wrong directory):
~/create-react-native-project.sh
```

### **Error: Script continues without waiting for input**
**Problem**: User input validation not working properly
**Solution**: The script now includes improved input validation that requires valid responses:
```bash
# The script will now loop until you provide valid input:
📱 Architecture Type: Must enter '1' or '2'
📚 Documentation: Must enter 'y' or 'n'  
🚀 Continue: Must enter 'y' or 'n'

# Invalid inputs will show error and ask again:
❌ Please enter 'y' for Yes or 'n' for No
```

### **Error: "binary operator expected"**
**Problem**: Script syntax error with input validation
**Solution**: Updated script fixes bash regex comparison issues

### **Error: "Permission denied"**
**Problem**: Script is not executable
**Solution**: Make the script executable:
```bash
