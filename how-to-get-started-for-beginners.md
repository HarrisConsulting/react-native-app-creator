# How to Get Started for Beginners

## üöÄ **Complete Guide for Creating Your First React Native App**

This guide will help you create your first React Native app using the react-native-app-creator tools, even if you're completely new to mobile development.

## üìã **Prerequisites: What You Need First**

### 1. **macOS Computer**
- React Native iOS development requires a Mac
- Make sure you have at least macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later

### 2. **Essential Tools to Download**

#### **Node.js** (Required)
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download and install the **LTS version** (Long Term Support)
3. This gives you `npm` (package manager) and `node` (JavaScript runtime)

#### **Xcode** (Required for iOS)
1. Open the **App Store** on your Mac
2. Search for "Xcode" and install it (it's free but large - about 15GB)
3. Once installed, open Xcode and accept the license agreement
4. Go to **Xcode ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Accounts** and sign in with your Apple ID

#### **VS Code** (Recommended Code Editor)
1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download and install Visual Studio Code
3. Install these helpful extensions:
   - **React Native Tools** (by Microsoft)
   - **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets**
   - **Prettier - Code formatter**

#### **CocoaPods** (iOS Dependencies)
1. Open **Terminal** (found in Applications ‚Üí Utilities)
2. Type: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
3. Enter your Mac password when prompted

### 3. **Additional Tools** (For Production Development)

#### **Watchman** (File Watching - Recommended)
1. Install via Homebrew (package manager for Mac):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   brew install watchman
   ```
2. Improves Metro bundler performance by watching file changes efficiently

#### **Git** (Version Control - Essential)
1. Usually pre-installed on macOS, check by typing `git --version` in Terminal
2. If not installed, download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
3. Set up your identity:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

#### **GitHub Desktop** (Git GUI - Beginner Friendly)
1. Download from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (create one at github.com if needed)
3. Easier way to manage code versions and backups

### 4. **Platform Accounts** (For Publishing Apps)

#### **Apple Developer Account** (Required for App Store)
- **Free**: Test on simulator and personal devices
- **Paid ($99/year)**: Publish to App Store, advanced features
- Sign up at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)

#### **GitHub Account** (Code Storage - Free)
- Create at [github.com](https://github.com) 
- Essential for backing up your code and collaborating
- Most development workflows expect Git/GitHub knowledge

## üéØ **Step-by-Step: Creating Your First App**

### **Step 1: Get the Creator Tools**
1. Open **Terminal**
2. Navigate to your Projects folder (or create one):
   ```bash
   cd ~/
   mkdir Projects
   cd Projects
   ```
3. Download or copy the `react-native-app-creator` folder to this location

### **Step 2: Create Your App**
1. In Terminal, navigate to the creator tools:
   ```bash
   cd react-native-app-creator
   ```
2. Run the app creator:
   ```bash
   ./create-react-native-app.sh
   ```
3. Follow the prompts:
   - **Project Name**: Choose something simple like "MyFirstApp" (no spaces)
   - **Description**: Optional, can skip by pressing Enter
   - **Architecture**: Choose "1" for Simple Single-Feature App (easier for beginners)
   - **Documentation**: Choose "Y" to include helpful guides

**Ready to configure your iOS settings?** Just run `npm run configure-ios` when you're ready!

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**
1. Run: ./create-react-native-app.sh
2. Follow prompts for project name and configuration

### **Step 4: Verify Everything is Ready**
```bash
npm run test-ios-build
```
This will check if everything is set up correctly and tell you if there are any issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Tools Overview**

### **Terminal (Command Line)**
- **What it is**: Text-based interface for running commands
- **How to open**: Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal
- **Basic commands you'll use**:
  - `cd foldername` - Change to a folder
  - `ls` - List files in current folder
  - `pwd` - Show current folder path

### **VS Code (Code Editor)**
- **What it is**: Where you'll write and edit your app's code
- **How to open your project**: 
  ```bash
  code .
  ```
  (Run this command in your app's folder)
- **Key files to know**:
  - `App.tsx` - Main app component (where you'll make changes)
  - `package.json` - App configuration and available commands

### **iOS Simulator**
- **What it is**: Virtual iPhone on your computer for testing
- **How it opens**: Automatically when you launch your app
- **Controls**: 
  - **Hardware ‚Üí Device** - Choose different iPhone models
  - **Hardware ‚Üí Home** - Go to home screen
  - **Device ‚Üí Shake Gesture** - Open developer menu

## üöÄ **Running Your App**

### **Start the Development Server (Metro)**
1. In Terminal, make sure you're in your app folder
2. Start Metro (the React Native bundler):
   ```bash
   npm run start-safe
   ```
3. Keep this Terminal window open - you'll see logs and any errors here

### **Launch in iOS Simulator**
1. Open a **new Terminal window** (‚åò+T)
2. Navigate to your app folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Projects/YourAppName
   ```
3. Launch the app:
