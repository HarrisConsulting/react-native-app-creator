# Simple React Native Project Creator - User Guide

**One-Script Solution**: Copy one file, run one command, get a complete React Native project with all ReactNativeTest patterns built-in.

---

## 🚀 **How to Use (3 Simple Steps)**

### **Step 1: Copy the Script**
```bash
# Copy the starter script to your Projects directory (*This command is one line*)
cp /Users/rogerharris/Projects/ReactNativeTest/scripts/create-react-native-project.sh /Users/rogerharris/Projects/

# Verify the script was copied successfully
ls -la /Users/rogerharris/Projects/create-react-native-project.sh
```

### **Step 2: Run the Script**
```bash
# Navigate to Projects directory and run
cd /Users/rogerharris/Projects
./create-react-native-project.sh
```

### **Step 3: Follow the Interactive Prompts**
The script will guide you through:
- ✅ Project name selection
- ✅ Architecture choice (simple vs multi-feature)
- ✅ Documentation integration option
- ✅ Complete project creation
- ✅ All necessary setup and configuration

**Enhanced Cancellation Protection**: If you choose not to continue after providing configuration, the script will ask for confirmation since you've already invested time in setup. You can choose to:
- **Continue** - Proceed with project creation  
- **Cancel** - Cancel and optionally start over
- **Start Over** - Restart the entire configuration process

**That's it!** ✨

## 📋 **Example Session**

```bash
# Step 1: Copy the script to Projects directory
cp /Users/rogerharris/Projects/ReactNativeTest/scripts/create-react-native-project.sh /Users/rogerharris/Projects/

# Step 2: Verify the copy was successful
ls -la /Users/rogerharris/Projects/create-react-native-project.sh
# Should show: -rwxr-xr-x ... create-react-native-project.sh

# Step 3: Navigate to Projects directory and run
cd /Users/rogerharris/Projects
./create-react-native-project.sh

# Interactive prompts:
🏷️  Project Name: TestAppF
📝 Project Description: My new React Native app
📱 Architecture Type: 1 (Simple Single-Feature)
📚 Add reusable documentation: y

📋 Configuration Summary
========================
  Project Name: TestAppF
  Location: /Users/rogerharris/Projects/TestAppF
  Architecture: Simple Single-Feature
  Documentation: Yes
  Description: My new React Native app

🚀 Continue with project creation? (y/n): n

⚠️  You've already provided project configuration:
   • Project Name: TestAppF
   • Architecture: Simple Single-Feature
   • Documentation: Yes

To confirm you want to cancel project creation, select: cancel
If you do not want to cancel, select: continue

1) continue  - Proceed with project creation
2) cancel    - Cancel project creation

Choose your action (1 for continue, 2 for cancel): 1
✅ Continuing with project creation...

# Script automatically:
# ✅ Creates TestAppF project
# ✅ Installs all dependencies  
# ✅ Copies configurations
# ✅ Sets up documentation
# ✅ Creates development guides
# ✅ Ready to run!

# Result: Complete project ready for development
cd TestAppF
npm run start-safe        # Start Metro
npm run ios-simulator     # Launch app
```

## � **Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues**

### **Error: "usage: cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n]..."**
**Problem**: Incomplete copy command
**Solution**: Make sure to include the complete command with target directory:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT:
cp /Users/rogerharris/Projects/ReactNativeTest/scripts/create-react-native-project.sh /Users/rogerharris/Projects/

# ❌ WRONG (missing target):
cp /Users/rogerharris/Projects/ReactNativeTest/scripts/
```

### **Error: "command not found: create-react-native-project.sh"**
**Problem**: Trying to run script from wrong directory or with wrong syntax
**Solution**: Navigate to Projects directory first, then run with `./`
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT:
cd /Users/rogerharris/Projects
./create-react-native-project.sh

# ❌ WRONG (missing ./ prefix):
create-react-native-project.sh

# ❌ WRONG (wrong directory):
~/create-react-native-project.sh
```

### **Error: Script continues without waiting for input**
**Problem**: User input validation not working properly
**Solution**: The script now includes improved input validation that requires valid responses:
```bash
# The script will now loop until you provide valid input:
📱 Architecture Type: Must enter '1' or '2'
📚 Documentation: Must enter 'y' or 'n'  
🚀 Continue: Must enter 'y' or 'n'

# Invalid inputs will show error and ask again:
❌ Please enter 'y' for Yes or 'n' for No
```

### **Error: "binary operator expected"**
**Problem**: Script syntax error with input validation
**Solution**: Updated script fixes bash regex comparison issues

### **Error: "Permission denied"**
**Problem**: Script is not executable
**Solution**: Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x /Users/rogerharris/Projects/create-react-native-project.sh
```

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check if script was copied correctly
ls -la /Users/rogerharris/Projects/create-react-native-project.sh

# Check if script is executable (should show 'x' in permissions)
ls -la /Users/rogerharris/Projects/create-react-native-project.sh

# Check current directory
pwd
# Should show: /Users/rogerharris/Projects
```

---

## 🎯 **Step-by-Step Copy-Paste Commands**

**For users who want exact commands to copy-paste:**

```bash
# 1. Copy the script (copy this entire line)
cp /Users/rogerharris/Projects/ReactNativeTest/scripts/create-react-native-project.sh /Users/rogerharris/Projects/

# 2. Verify it was copied
ls -la /Users/rogerharris/Projects/create-react-native-project.sh

# 3. Navigate to Projects directory
cd /Users/rogerharris/Projects

# 4. Make sure you're in the right place
pwd

### **Verification Commands**
./create-react-native-project.sh
```
